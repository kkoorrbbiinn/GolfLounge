It was a cool evening, we dined inside, but the fire pit was going. The gal who had been here before ordered the chicken pot pie (saw it her last visit and said “ I’m going to get that next time”). Now that’s what I’m saying. I was not disappointed with my choice tho…..buffalo cauliflower on wedge with blue cheese chunks-a taste sensation!!!! I also enjoyed the Yellowstone Old Fashioned.',

//         review: 'We both ate and golfed at Troon North. First, the restaurant is great. It\'s got good energy, great food, and wonderful service by the whole staff. Dina was especially helpful.The prices were reasonable for such a nice spot and they have good daily specials with great views while you dine. The golf course if fully 5 stars. Keep in mind the price can be very high especially if you are renting clubs (an additional $79); but really consider getting a Troon Card where you can get great deals. Our $310 per person greens fee was even higher with the taxes and fees. The course itself is really nicely maintained and the views are spectacular. It\'s a bit challenging for a regular golfer and the ranger pushes everyone; but it\'s truly a 5 star experience all around. There are a number of holes where you have to get well over a wash or out-of-bounds area but that made it challenging and exciting. (Take extra balls : ). We went on a day where it was cart-path-only and it really slowed us down with how wide some of the holes are. We thought about coming back on another day and should have done that. It was very crowded but we thought it was reasonable to be done in 4.5 hours. It can get windy and chilly in the winter - glad we had jackets. It was a wonderful experience.',
